Simple wifi controlled robot, powered by NodeMCU (esp8266)

This is a simple robot I've upgraded for my daughters. It's based on a simple robot toy made by Clementoni (Italy) that I already had.

The original robot uses two geared DC motors controlling the wheels, and is programmable using some pushbuttons on its control circuit. Using the buttons is possible to store a movement sequence and execute it. Since I think this is not quite funny, I've rebuilt its control board using a NodeMCU (esp8266) making it wifi controlled, in real time.

This project is based on original work done by **MertArduino** (https://www.instructables.com/NodeMCU-ESP8266-WiFi-Robot-Car-Controlled-by-Appli/)
